    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2-ish kg. pork shoulder/butt - pork for Pernil will work well too</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

        <li>Add the lard, spices and Coke/OJ.</li>
        <li>Simmer until the liquid is almost gone. Skim off any foam/crud that rises to the top.</li>
        <li>Once the liquid is mostly gone increase the heat to high.</li>
        <li>Fry the meat until until it's browned and crispy. Shred the meat into smaller pices while it is frying.</li>
